Car Price Prediction

Description:

Car Price Prediction is a Python project aimed at predicting car prices using regression techniques. Leveraging a dataset containing information about various car attributes such as mileage, engine volume, brand, body type, and more, this project employs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model fitting, assumption checking, and model evaluation to accurately predict car prices.

Key Features:

Data Cleaning and EDA: The script begins with data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers. It then conducts exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable (car prices).

Model Fitting: Regression models are fitted to the cleaned dataset using the StatsModels library. The script provides a summary of the model, including coefficients, p-values, and goodness-of-fit statistics.

Assumption Checking: Assumptions of regression analysis, such as normality of errors, equal variance of errors, multicollinearity, and outliers influence, are checked to ensure the validity of the model.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the regression model is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared and root mean squared error (RMSE) on both training and testing datasets.
